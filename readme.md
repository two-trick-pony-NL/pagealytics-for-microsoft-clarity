# Pagelytics - iOS client for Microsoft Clarity
Pagelytics is a native iOS app that brings your Microsoft Clarity data straight to your pocket. It’s designed for makers, marketers, and product people who want clarity (pun intended) without logging into yet another web dashboard.

I built it for me — but if you’re using Clarity, it might be exactly what you’re missing too.

# 💡 Why Clarity?
Microsoft Clarity is free, powerful, and actually kind of amazing for session replays, heatmaps, and spotting frustration points like rage clicks. And I have been using it on almost all of my side projects. But it’s very desktop-oriented. The lack of mobile access was a pain, especially during crunch times when I wasn’t at my laptop.

I wanted something mobile-first. Just like Scout is for Mixpanel — I wanted the same vibe, but for Clarity.

# 🔍 What Pagelytics Does
- 🔥 View recent sessions — Instantly see how many visitors you’re attracting users are doing
- 🎯 Spot rage clicks — Know exactly how many users are struggling
- 📊 Top pages — See what pages are actually getting traffic (this was really usefull after I recently launched some blog posts for Voice Mate about Hubspot and Google Calendar
- 💪🏻 Engagement — Find out how far users scroll and how much time they spend
‼️ Find errors — Again super usefull when on the fly. If you deploy a new version and see your Javascript errors going to 80% of visits and the only place you use Javascript is on your signup form then you know you have an all-nighter ahead of you.

It connects via the official Clarity Data Export API and shows you the important stuff — no bloat, no fuss no account registration. We keep your Clarity API key on your device so we don’t even have a server.
